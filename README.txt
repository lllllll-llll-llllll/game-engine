This is a simple visual-novel-esque game engine made in autoit in 2019. Nothing has been made with this engine, it was made for fun.

I can't remember the exact details but the entire game is typed in plaintext in "script.txt" and within there is a mix of code and data.
Lines are parsed and interpreted as commands using a stack... there is variable assignment, evaluating expressions, displaying text, prompting choices, loops, subroutines/functions, goto, macros...
See the "script.txt" example to understand the syntax.
